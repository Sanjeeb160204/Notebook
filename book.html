          Sitting here, with nothing but quiet and pain,<br />
          All I do is wish things could be the same.<br />
          Not a day goes by that I donâ€™t see her face,<br />
          Just her memory, filling up every space.<br />
          Each rose that blooms, I think of her name,<br />
          Even in silence, I canâ€™t forget this flame.<br />
          But she doesnâ€™t love me, I know thatâ€™s true.<br />
          <br />
          Looking at her photo, I still feel the spark,<br />
          Old memories haunt me, deep in the dark.<br />
          Visiting places where we used to roam,<br />
          Every step I take, I feel so alone.<br />
          She doesnâ€™t care anymore; Iâ€™m left behind.<br />
          <br />
          Remembering her laugh, her eyes, her smile,<br />
          I loved her deeply, though it was never worthwhile.<br />
          My heart still holds on, but I canâ€™t pretend,<br />
          I long for a time when this pain will end.<br />
          <br />
          So much love thatâ€™s never been returned,<br />
          Only memories left that leave me burned.<br />
          <br />
          My tears have soaked this year in despair,<br />
          Under this sky, Iâ€™m lost in thin air.<br />
          Carrying her absence, itâ€™s all I can do,<br />
          Hoping she finds a love thatâ€™s true.<br />

            Roses may bloom, but none can match your grace,</br>
            In your eyes, the world finds its place.</br>
            Moonlit nights carry your name in the air,</br>
            In the quiet of my soul, you are always there.</br>
            </br>
            Stars may fade in your gentle light,</br>
            Holding onto dreams of you through the night.</br>
            Under the sky, my heart silently calls,</br>
            Keeping your image, where love never falls.</br>
            Love so deep, even in the darkest despair,</br>
            As I breathe, your presence fills the air.

          The roads, the grounds, the parksâ€”every corner reminds me of her, 
          even though she never felt the same way. I still walk the paths we once took, 
          feeling the weight of those memories with every step. The breeze feels familiar, 
          carrying a scent that pulls me back to moments where her presence made the world feel brighter. 
          Sneaking around and meeting her, hiding from everyone, had its own kind of thrill, 
          turning simple moments into something special. Now, even though sheâ€™s not here, 
          it feels like sheâ€™s everywhereâ€”her memory tied to the trees, the rustling leaves, 
          and the soft touch of the wind against my face. Itâ€™s strange how everything around me 
          seems to hold a piece of her, making this place both comforting and 
          heartbreaking at the same time.

          I stepped into my room after so long,</br>

          Remembering a bond that once felt so strong.</br>
          Every glance at the gift she gave me that day,</br>
          A piece of her love that still wonâ€™t fade away.</br>
          Life feels so strange now sheâ€™s not with me,</br>
          Like those moments she says werenâ€™t meant to be.</br>
          Yet the gift broke by mistake, but still, on the wall,</br>
        </br>
          Making the idol remain safe, standing proud and tall.</br>
          I often stand there, wishing she could know,</br>
          Still hoping deep down sheâ€™d never let go.</br>
          So many memories rush back through my mind,</br>
        </br>
          Under this gift, I leave the past behind.</br>
          Holding on to a love I canâ€™t unwind.</br>

          I still remember the first roses I gave her. She held them
           like they were the most delicate thing in the world, but in truth,
            she was the one who looked more beautiful than anything I could ever give.
             Her smile that dayâ€”it wasnâ€™t just a smile; it was magic. It made everything 
             around me feel brighter, like the whole world had come alive just for her. 
             But then she walked away from my life, and now I canâ€™t see that smile anymore. 
             I miss it, I miss her. I keep hoping for one small moment, even just a word 
             from her, but maybe sheâ€™ll never understand what she meant to me. If only 
             weâ€™d met in another time, in another version of life, maybe things wouldâ€™ve 
             been different. But now itâ€™s just a lingering dream I canâ€™t let go of. I know that  
             itâ€™s not about when someone comes into your life, but who stays until the end. 
             And even if sheâ€™s gone, I know Iâ€™ll always be here for her, no matter what.

          I saw my whole world in her eyes, </br>
Like the stars that light up the skies. </br>
Her eyes were brighter than the moon, </br>
A warmth that made my heart swoon. </br>

I used to stare for hours, lost, </br>
Her gaze, a feeling I canâ€™t exhaust. </br>
In every blink, a dream took flight, </br>
I thought I'd live forever in her light. </br>

No moonlight could match her shine, </br>
Her eyes, more beautiful, more divine. </br>
At night, under the blanket's fold, </br>
I'd look at her pictures, feeling bold. </br>

But as I stared, tears would fall, </br>
Her eyes made me feel so small. </br>
I miss them now more than before, </br>
Her bright eyes, the one I adored. </br>

I never wanted to let them go, </br>
Her gaze was all I needed to know. </br>
Now they're just memories in my heart, </br>
A love that I can't quite restart.

          Loneliness grows stronger, and I feel broken.</br>

          Knowing youâ€™re out there, but I feel forgotten.</br></br>
          But Iâ€™ll wait for you, even if it takes years.</br>
          All my dreams still carry the hope and the fears.</br>
          Clouds of doubt fill my mind, but Iâ€™m not letting go.</br>
          Holding on, because I love you more than you know.</br>
